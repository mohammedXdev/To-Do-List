Hi there, I've made my first project "TO DO LIST" while learning Javascript by following a youtube tutorial and I am looking forward for building the projects on my own and there are a few 
more projects that I made while learning Javascript 
features of the TO DO LIST :
In this TO DO LIST you can add, remove, check & uncheck your tasks efficiently 
It saves data in your local storage so you can keep the track of it :)



& i am a complete beginner in progamming and it is also my first time using github
